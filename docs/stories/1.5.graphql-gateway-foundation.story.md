# Story 1.5: GraphQL Gateway Foundation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** a GraphQL gateway that aggregates all backend services,
**so that** I can query data from multiple services in a single request.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GraphQL gateway service created with Hot Chocolate Federation
2. Gateway aggregates schemas from Auth Service and Form Builder Service
3. GraphQL schema includes Form and User types with relationships
4. Query operations implemented (getForms, getForm, getCurrentUser)
5. Mutation operations implemented (createForm, updateForm, deleteForm)
6. Authentication middleware integrated (JWT token validation)
7. Error handling for GraphQL operations with proper error types
8. API documentation (GraphQL Playground) accessible
9. Unit tests for GraphQL resolvers with >80% coverage
10. Integration tests for gateway endpoints

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2:
- Auth Service is implemented with JWT token generation
- User profile endpoint available (GET /api/auth/me)

From Story 1.3:
- Form Builder Service is implemented with REST API
- Form CRUD endpoints available

### Data Models

**GraphQL Types:**
```graphql
type Form {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  schema: JSON!
  version: String!
  status: FormStatus!
  createdBy: User!
  tenantId: ID!
  tags: [String!]!
  category: String
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  displayName: String!
  roles: [String!]!
  tenantId: ID!
}

enum FormStatus {
  DRAFT
  PUBLISHED
  ARCHIVED
}

type Query {
  forms(filter: FormFilter, pagination: Pagination): FormConnection!
  form(id: ID!): Form
  currentUser: User
}

type Mutation {
  createForm(input: CreateFormInput!): Form!
  updateForm(id: ID!, input: UpdateFormInput!): Form!
  deleteForm(id: ID!): Boolean!
}
```

### Testing Requirements

**Test File Location:**
- Backend unit tests: `apps/integration-gateway-service/tests/Unit/GraphQL/`
- Backend integration tests: `apps/integration-gateway-service/tests/Integration/GraphQL/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Backend: xUnit + Moq [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Patterns:**
- Unit tests for GraphQL resolvers (mock HTTP clients)
- Integration tests for GraphQL endpoints (test full query/mutation cycle)
- Test authentication flow
- Test error handling
- Test schema federation

**Test Coverage Target:** >80% for business logic [Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend Framework: ASP.NET Core 8.0 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- GraphQL: Hot Chocolate with Federation [Source: docs/architecture.md#components - Integration Gateway Service]
- HTTP Client: HttpClientFactory for backend service calls

**Hot Chocolate Configuration:**
- Enable Federation for schema stitching
- Configure service endpoints (Auth Service, Form Builder Service)
- Set up authentication middleware
- Configure error handling

**Service Communication:**
- Use HTTP clients to call backend REST APIs
- Pass JWT token from gateway to backend services
- Handle service failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `AuthService__BaseUrl` - Auth Service base URL
- `FormBuilderService__BaseUrl` - Form Builder Service base URL
- `JWT__Issuer` - JWT issuer (for token validation)
- `JWT__Audience` - JWT audience (for token validation)
